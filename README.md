# Ransomware

# Instructions for Handling Ransomware Encryption and Decryption

# Running the Ransomware Script:
When you execute the ransomware.py file on your system, all .txt files will be encrypted.

# Secret Key Generation:
The encryption process uses a secret key that is saved in a file named secret.key. This file will be created automatically when you run the ransomware.py script.

# Important:
To ensure you can recover your data, do not modify or delete the secret.key file. It is essential for the decryption process.

# Data Recovery:
To decrypt and recover your encrypted files, you need to use the ransom_decrypt.py script. Ensure that the secret.key file is present and unchanged on your system before running this decryption script.
